==========

Experiments in determining the bph of a (pocket) watch

 * experiment\_one.py
  * This will give you an average if you know the rough bph.
 * experiment\_two.py
  * This will detect the bph based on a list of common bph (note, t.wav is
	fabricated?)
  * The average will be shown at the end per each common bph
